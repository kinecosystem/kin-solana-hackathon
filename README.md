# Solana Season Hackathon · Kin

Kin offers a monetization model that incentivizes the adoption of cryptocurrency into apps and websites, as well as encouraging the exchange of value between users.

## Project Vision

Kin is used as money within a digital ecosystem of consumer applications and services. Kin coins enter circulation via an incentive model referred to as the [Kin Rewards Engine](https://github.com/kinecosystem/rewards-engine/blob/master/current-KRE.md) (KRE) which rewards the developers that create compelling and engaging user experiences, based on Kin.

## $25,000 in prizes

Kin will offer $25,000 in prizes, as well as the ability to qualify for potential further funding from our [grant programs](https://kin.org/catalyst-fund/) to successful submissions. Future funding is provided at our discretion, depending on the potential of the project.

  

The leading project will win $12,000 in Kin. Two runner ups will be awarded $3,500 each. In addition, up to 3 other teams could win additional “Best of” prizes focused on:
 1. The Best UX/UI
 2. Most Creative Idea
 3. Biggest Market Potential

 Note: A leading or runner-up winner can only win in one additional “Best of” category.

  Winners will be chosen based on evaluation by a panel of judges with expertise in crypto-based user experiences.

## Guidelines

We will award projects that integrate Kin (including Web3, DeFi or NFT) in a way that creates a compelling Kin-based economy within the App, based on earning and spending Kin in creative ways. Projects will be awarded based on originality, usefulness and potential impact. Entrants are encouraged to be creative but can also fork open source projects they feel would benefit Kin.

  

Entrants are encouraged to create projects based on our brand new [WebSDK](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-web). (Note this is in beta) This newly released SDK enables developers to create Kin enabled applications (including browser extensions) in [React](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-demo-react), [Vue](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-demo-vue) and [Angular](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-demo-angular). Our other Android and iOS SDKs are [described here](https://kintegrate.dev/).

Eligible apps and services using official Kin SDKs are also welcome to join the [Kin Rewards Engine](https://kin.org/kin-rewards-engine/) to earn weekly rewards for their efforts.
